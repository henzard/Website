## 🆕 What's New in v2.0.0

### **14-error-handling** (CRITICAL)
- React Error Boundaries with fallback UI
- Custom error classes (ValidationError, AuthError, etc.)
- Global error handler service
- User-friendly error messages
- Logging service with sanitization
- Sentry integration for production
- Axios interceptors for API errors
- Complete error handling patterns

**Why it's critical:** Proper error handling is the difference between a professional app and one that crashes randomly.

### **12-performance-standards**
- Bundle size optimization (code splitting, tree shaking)
- Image optimization (WebP, AVIF, lazy loading)
- React performance (memoization, virtual lists)
- Firebase query optimization
- Service workers & caching
- Web Vitals monitoring
- Performance budgets

**Why it matters:** Fast apps feel more reliable and professional. Performance is a ranking factor for SEO.

### **13-seo-standards**
- Complete meta tag templates
- Structured data (JSON-LD) schemas
- Dynamic sitemap generation
- Robots.txt configuration
- Semantic HTML requirements
- Google Analytics integration
- Mobile SEO compliance

**Why it matters:** No traffic = no users. SEO is how people find your site.

### **15-payment-processing**
- Complete Stripe integration
- Payment intent creation
- Webhook handling with signature verification
- Refund processing
- Invoice generation
- Subscription billing
- PCI compliance through Stripe
- Never store card data

**Why it matters:** Payments must be secure and compliant. One security issue can destroy trust.

### **16-email-system**
- SendGrid/Mailgun integration
- Professional email templates (HTML + text)
- Welcome, verification, booking confirmation emails
- Unsubscribe management
- Email analytics
- CAN-SPAM/GDPR compliance

- react-i18next setup
- Translation file structure
- Language switcher component
- Date/number/currency formatting
- RTL (Arabic, Hebrew) support
- Hreflang tags for SEO
- Translation workflow

**Why it matters:** Even if you start with one language, building with i18n from day one is 10x easier than adding it later.
